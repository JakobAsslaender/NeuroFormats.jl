# NeuroFormats.jl

Handling of structural neuroimaging file formats for [Julia](https://julialang.org).

## About

Some basic packages for reading neuroimaging data files are available from [JuliaNeuroscience](https://github.com/JuliaNeuroscience), e.g., NIFTI volume and GIFTI mesh support. In this NeuroFormats package, we will provide an API, similar to that of the [freesurferformats R package](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats), for reading structural neuroimaging data files in Julia. The focus will be on surface-based data, as produced by [FreeSurfer](https://freesurfer.net).

## Installation and Usage

This is still WIP. Please come back later.
