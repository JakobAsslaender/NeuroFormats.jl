# NeuroFormats.jl

Handling of structural neuroimaging file formats for [Julia](https://julialang.org).


## About

In the NeuroFormats package, we will provide an API for reading structural neuroimaging data files in Julia. The focus will be on surface-based data, as produced by [FreeSurfer](https://freesurfer.net). The aim of the package is to allow scientists to access their neuroimaging data in Julia so they can use the language's power to implement custom data analysis pipelines.

Note that some functions for reading neuroimaging data files are available from [JuliaNeuroscience](https://github.com/JuliaNeuroscience), e.g., NIFTI volume and GIFTI mesh support. This package does not duplicate these functionalities.

## Features

* Read and write FreeSurfer per-vertex data in curv format (like `subject/surf/lh.thickness`): functions `read_curv()` and `write_curv()`
* Read brain meshes in FreeSurfer binary mesh format (like `subject/surf/lh.white`): `read_surf()`
* Read FreeSurfer label files (like `subject/label/lh.cortex.label`): `read_label()`
* Read FreeSurfer brain surface parcellations (like `subject/label/lh.aparc.annot`): `read_annot()`
* Read DTI track data from MRtrix3 TCK files: `read_tck()`
* Read DTI track data from DiffusionToolkit TRK files: `read_trk()`


## Installation

You can find [NeuroFormats on JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/NeuroFormats/zxLcF/), so all you need to do is:

```julia
Pkg.add("NeuroFormats")
```

from a Julia session.


## Documentation

The documentation is included with the package and can be [browsed online at JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/docs/NeuroFormats/zxLcF/). It is not repeated on this website. 

Also keep in mind that you can always get help on a function named `read_curv` from within Julia by typing `?read_curv`. The [unit tests of this package](./test/) are essentially a collection of usage examples.


## Usage Example

This example shows how to load a FreeSurfer brain mesh with per-vertex data and visualize it in Julia using GLMakie:

```julia
using NeuroFormats
using GLMakie

# I assume you have a subject / MRI scan preprocessed with FreeSurfer in this dir.
fs_subject_dir = joinpath(homedir(), "data/study1/subject1/")

surf = read_surf(joinpath(fs_subject_dir, "surf/lh.white"))

# An Array{Float32, 1} with your cortical thickness data.
curv = read_curv(joinpath(fs_subject_dir, "surf/lh.thickness"))

vertices = surf.mesh.vertices
faces = surf.mesh.faces .+ 1

scene = mesh(vertices, faces, color = curv)
```
