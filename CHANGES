NeuroFormats.jl Changes
=======================

Version 0.2.0
--------------
- BREAKING: no longer exports `interpret_fs_int24` function. This function was exported by accident and it is very unlikely that people used it.
- Support reading the MRtrix TCK format: function `read_tck`
- Support reading the TRK format used by the Diffusion Toolkit and TrackVis: `read_trk`
- Add introduction page to documentation, fix generation of API docs.
